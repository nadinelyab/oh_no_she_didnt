Gossip.create! celebrity_name:"Miley Cyrus", title:"Home Wreck-ing Ball", author: "Daria McDrunkin", date_published: "September 4th, 2013", gossip_scale:"7", story: "We all saw this coming.
Reps for both Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have confirmed to People magazine that the pair have called off their engagement.
This past weekend Cyrus unfollowed Hemsworth on Twitter, adding fuel to long-held rumors that the relationship had ended months ago.
Cyrus, 20, and Hemsworth, 23, began dating in 2009 after starring together in The Last Song, and became engaged on May 31, 2012.
Sources told E! News the split was Miley's decision, after coming to grips with Liam being what she believed was less than faithful to her.
Back in February, Star magazine first reported that Hemsworth got hot and heavy with Mad Men star January Jones at a pre-Oscars party at the Chateau Marmont hotel. Those cheating rumors flared up again last week, when Us Weekly reported that Hemsworth has been sexting the 35-year-old actress.
After months of ongoing rumors, Miley Cyrus finally decided that she DONE with the lying and the cheating. She decided that it was time to teach Ms. Jones a lesson. So, Miley did what she does best: go bat-shit crazy on ereybody’s asses.
Yesterday, while January Jones was minding her own business, eating a bowl of Pops cereal bathed in lactose-free milk , out of nowhere, a giant, metallic wrecking ball came crashing through her kitchen wall. Ms. Jones scrambled under a table, protecting her Pops with her life. Soon after the crash, Miley Cyrus reportedly appeared through the giant gaping hole dressed as a teddy bear high on crack with her “J”s on.
“So, I heard you have been sending some nudies to my boy.” Cyrus said. “Do you know what I have to do to you now?”.
“What!?!” Cried Jones.
“Hand over the Pops, bitch”
“No, please, anything but the Pops. Take me instead!”
Cyrus proceeded to charge at Jones while singing the phrase “I can’t stop/ Give me your Pops”. Jones quickly swallowed the rest of the contents of her bowl just before Cyrus could get to her. The rest of the fight consisted mainly of Cyrus licking Jones face with her 10 foot long tongue in order to wear her down. 
Just before Cyrus could finish her, Jones cried out “I know your secret!”
“What do you mean?” Cyrus said, confused.
“You’re Hannah Montana!”
“NO, HOW DID YOU FIND OUT!?!?! AHG MY EYES, WHY DO MY EYES BURN”
In the next moment, Jones witnessed Cyrus’s body melting before her. In her last moments of life, Cyrus reportedly said the phrase “I think my next music video will picture me riding a wrecking ball naked, I’ll call the song: “Wrecking Ball vs. cinderblock wall vs. me naked. Yeah, that’s good.”
Well folks, that’s the full story, but who knows if it is actually true. I mean, I am writing this at the Dubliner drunk off my ass right now, so I’m just praying that I don’t get fired so I can continuing fueling my Nyquil addiction.
Goodbye, Felicia!
Love,
Daria McDrunkin"
